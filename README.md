# news-ocracy
This project was created with requirements of using the News Api and high school teachers as end users.  With fake news so prevalent right now, I wanted to gear this project toward civics and social studies high school classes.  News sources spanned the spectrum from mostly liberal to mainstream to mostly conservative sources.  

It was made using The News API and Create-React-App.
